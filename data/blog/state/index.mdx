One of the most important topics in React is **state**. State consists
of any data your application needs to know about, that **can** change
over lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state
as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.
Let's create an user component with message state:

```jsx {}
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      message: ' Welcome to React world'
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

State is similar to props, but it is **private** and **fully** controlled by the component.
It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.
