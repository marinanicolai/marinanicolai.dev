So you learned HTML and CSS and you are ready for the next adventure.Before you jump and choose PHP or other programming languages which the internet claims are easier to learn, I would like to grab your attention and hopefully convince you that next language to learn should be Javascript. Why JS?

You can use it as you are learning it:
I had two semesters of Java at school and it is sooo foreign to learn about something which you can’t actually use in your daily life, same as learning about polar bears or penguins, and who knows if you will ever see them. Javascript on the other hand is in your browser!!!This means you can see the interaction with it as you build each line of code.

Js is everywhere
In the same way as I would tell an immigrant who comes to the US “learn to drive so you will have an easier life,” I am telling you "learn JS if you want to enter the development world."From validating the passwords, to displaying a slider, you need JS.

JS is a two-in-one type of thing.
Why overwhelm your brain with more than it needs if you can learn only one language to do the front and the back end tasks?
JS can be used to develop an app and be deployed without a server!

Let the fun begin!
