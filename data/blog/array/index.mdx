In JavaScript, an array is an order list of values. Each value is called an element
specified by an index. An array can hold values of mixed types(number, string or
boolean). JavaScript arrays are dynamic.

Let’s use metaphors explaining arrays as this is my favorite part.... Arrays are like
the following: Christmas lists, dollar bills stacked in your wallet, or credit card
bill statement; if the payment is made on time, it's marked in green and if it's paid
late, it's marked in red.

Everywhere where there is an order, there is an array around us, and if there’s not an array, then it’s not good ;)!
