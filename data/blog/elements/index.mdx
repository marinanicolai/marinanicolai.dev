The basic building block in React is the React element.Let's look at one example
of an Vanila React without the Babel compliler.

```
const hello = React.createElement(
    'p',
    { className: 'featured' },
    'Hello');
```

However if we were to pass this object into the ReactDOM library, we would get something like this:

```
<p class="featured">Hello</p>
```
