When our state logic becomes more complicated, we are going to need to ensure that we keep the
state consistent. In order to do so, we should use a Reducer Hook instead of multiple State Hooks,
because it is harder to maintain synchronicity between multiple State Hooks that depend on each other.

The signature for the useReducer hook is as follows:

```
[]reduce(render, initialState)

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

function reducer (state, value) {
    return state + value
}
...
displatch(1)
```
