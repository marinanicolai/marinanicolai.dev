summary: In this article I am comparing an example of a list written in HTML and how the same list can be written in JSX.

One of the most important topics in React is **props** or **properties**.
_Props are for components the same as what variables are for functions!_
Let me repeat it again: _Props are for components the same as what variables are for functions!_
Let us take a look at one example:

- Dried Apricots with 381 Calories gives your body 6.3mg iron per 100g.
- White Beans with 249 Calories gives your body 6.6mg iron per 100g.
- Spinach with 41 Calories gives your body 6.4mg iron per 100g.

#### In html if you wish to write this list, you would type the following code:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Dried Apricots with 381 Calories gives your body 6.3mg iron per 100g.</li>
  <li>White Beans with 249 Calories gives your body 6.6mg iron per 100g.</li>
  <li>Spinach with 41 Calories gives your body 6.4mg iron per 100g.</li>
</ul>
```

However if we take a look at the list we can see the repetition.

- **Product** (_Dried Apricots_) with **calories** (_381_) Calories gives your body **iron level **(_6.3mg_) iron per 100g.
- **Product** (_White Beans_) with **calories** (_249_) Calories gives your body **iron level ** (_6.6mg_) iron per 100g.
- **Product** (_Spinach_) with **calories** (_41_) Calories gives your body **iron level **(_6.4mg_) iron per 100g.

Let's create a function which can help us describe each of the products without repetition.

```jsx {7}
function Product(props) {
  return (
    <li>
      {props.name} with {props.calories} Calories gives your body{' '}
      {props.ironLevel} iron per 100g.
    </li>
  );
}
```

As you can see with only one line of code in JSX we can replace **three** lines of code in HTML.
