API stands for Application Program Interface

One of the best analogy is the client-server/waiter/kitchen.So in this example the waiter serves as API request
and the the customer as a client.

**REST** stands for
Representational State Transfer.
Architecture style for designing networked applications.
Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP.
Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed.
Can be used by virtualy any programming language.

HTTP Methods:
GET: Retrive data from a specifies resource
POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
PUT: Update a specified resource
DELETE: Delete a specified resource

HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods
PATCH: Update partial resorces

Endpoints - the URI/URL where api/service can be accessed by a client application

GET https://mysite.com/api/users
GET https://mysite.com/api/users/1
POST https://mysite.com/api/users // will add a user to the request
PUT https://mysite.com/api/users/1 //will update the user
DELETE https://mysite.com/api/users/1 //will delete the user

Authentication

Some API's require authentication to use their service. This could be free or paid.

Examples:
curl -H "Authorization:token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com
