> Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

Let's look at one example of an Vanila React without the Babel compliler.

```
function List() {
      return (
        React.createElement("ul", { className: "react-links", id: "top" },
          React.createElement("li", {},
            React.createElement("a", { href: "https://reactjs.org/docs" }, "React Docs")
          ),
          React.createElement("li", {},
            React.createElement("a", { href: "https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html" }, "ReactDOM Docs")
          ),
      )
    }
```

However if we were to pass this object into the ReactDOM library, we would get something like this:

```
<ul class="react-links" id="top">
    <li>
        <a href="http://reactjs.org/docs">
            React Docs
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html">
            ReactDOM Docs
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
```

In React we mainly have two types of components:

**Functional** Components and **Class** Components. However, there are
other components in React that goes similar to these two components.

### 1. Functional Components:

> These components are purely presentational and are simply represented by a function that optionally takes props and returns a React element to be rendered to the page.

Generally, it is preferred to use **functional** components whenever possible because of their predictability and conciseness. Since, they are purely presentational, their output is always the same given the same props.

You may find functional components referred to as _stateless, dumb_ or _presentational_ in other literature. All these names are derived from the simple nature that functional components take on.

**Functional** because they are basically functions.

**Stateless** because they do not hold and/or manage state.

**Presentational** because all they do is output UI elements.

Below shows two examples of functional component in React:

```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1> Hello React! </h1>;
}
```

```jsx
const Greeting = () => <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m a dumb component!</h1>;
```

### 2. Class Components:

```jsx

```

**6. Presentational Components:**

**7. Container Components:**
