One of the most important information is data types: primitive and object.
Type is a classification of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how to use the data.
So the primitive data is number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
Number is number; string is textual data; boolean is a data type that returns either of two values; undefined is a variable that has not been assigned a value; null represents a missing value.
Reference type is objects, array and function.

I like metaphors because it helps me understand unfamiliar subjects better and relate them to my daily life. So comparing these two types to our daily lives the primitive type of data is like a wild animal in the wild. It just exists.It doesn't have a house but it’s there in the world(as if it were in your file). The reference data on the other hand is similar to an animal in the zoo.You know exactly where to find it: if you need it, you know it’s address.

Understanding the data type is crucial in working with it!
