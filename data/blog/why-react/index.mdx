As Spring semester ended last week. I couldn't wait to get back to learn React and got myself a [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1798752980/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to read while enjoying the sun, by Zac Gordon.
The introduction is amazing and emphasises why in the first place we have to sweat and learn React. I should have made this article my first one. However it's never too late. Here are the main reasons why React is so great:

1.Simplicity

_The siplicity of React is that it is a user interface library._

The component based approach, well defined lifecycle, and reusable UI components makes React very simple to learn.

2.Ingenuity

Just imagine for a second that applications like _Facebook, Instagram, Skype and Uber;_ would take _a while_ to load.
How will we be able to snoop on our friends or enemies, on our lunch break?
How we will be able to find that recipe at the stop-light?
How will be able to join the zoom meetings and skype while using our phones?
And the most important how would we get home after a party if Uber didn't exist?

All of these applications run on React.js<span aria-label="a rocket blasting off" role="img">ðŸš€</span>One of the greatest assets is having a virtual DOM.The virtual DOM is used for all the components. The React-DOM happens to build necessary updates on its
own and render it to the real DOM-tree.

3.Right place!

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook in 2011. Having said that the documentation and
support for this framework is tremendous.
